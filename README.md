# visual-recognition
This is an implementation of several CV tools, based on the assignments of Stanford's course CS231n - 
**Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition**

Although this project aims to accomplish the objectives of the assignments made by CS231n staff, it was written independently from scratch, without any copied code.

Of course, all credits for professional guidance, including detailed instructions and project layout, goes to Stanford's CS231n great staff:
